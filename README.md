# rakuen

A build environment for my personal projects.

* Uses the latest Ubuntu release
* Based on [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and [Stackage Nightly](https://www.stackage.org/nightly)
* Pre-installs a bunch of packages. Selection of packages is super opinionated.
* Built on [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/), not my laptop
